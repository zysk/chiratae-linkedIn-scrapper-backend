3. **Unique Test Data**: Implemented dynamic unique identifiers to prevent conflicts with existing data
4. **Port Conflict Resolution**: Created scripts to detect and resolve port conflicts

## Conclusion

All tests for the LinkedIn Account and Proxy Management system are now passing successfully. The system properly implements the required functionality for managing LinkedIn accounts and proxies, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. The rotation functionality for getting the next available account or proxy is also working as expected.
