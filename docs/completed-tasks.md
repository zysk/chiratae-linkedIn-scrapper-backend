# Completed Tasks

## Task #1: Project Foundation Setup

**Status:** Completed

### Implementation Overview:

This task involved setting up the TypeScript project structure with Express server, MongoDB connection, and basic middleware configuration. The following components were implemented:

1. **Configuration**:
   - Created a robust configuration system in `src/config/config.ts` that loads from environment variables
   - Implemented environment variable validation with detailed error reporting
   - Added support for different environments (development, production)

2. **Database Connection**:
   - Implemented a dedicated database utility in `src/utils/db.util.ts`
   - Added robust error handling for MongoDB connections
   - Configured proper connection options and event listeners
   - Added connection string masking for secure logging

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Created a comprehensive error handling system with custom error types in `src/utils/error-types.util.ts`
   - Implemented a central error handling middleware in `src/middlewares/error.middleware.ts`
   - Added 404 handling for missing routes
   - Standardized error responses across the application

4. **API Response Standardization**:
   - Created a utility for standardized API responses in `src/utils/api-response.util.ts`
   - Implemented success, error, paginated, and no-content response formats
   - Added support for metadata and consistent structure

5. **Server Initialization**:
   - Updated `src/bin/www.ts` with improved error handling and logging
   - Added proper cleanup for graceful shutdown
   - Implemented signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
   - Added handlers for uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections

### Future Improvements:

- Add database connection pooling configuration
- Implement request validation middleware
- Add request logging middleware

## Task #11: Fix Linting Issues and Implement Consistent Error Logging Strategy (In Progress)

**Status:** In Progress

### Implementation Overview:

This task involves addressing linting issues and implementing a proper error logging strategy. The following progress has been made:

1. **Console Replacement Script**:
   - Created a specialized script in `scripts/fix-console-logs.js` to replace console.log statements with logger calls
   - Script intelligently adds Logger imports and creates logger instances where needed
   - Added support for different log levels (info, warn, error)

2. **Script Configuration**:
   - Added ESLint configuration for scripts in `scripts/.eslintrc.json` to properly handle Node.js environment
   - Updated package.json scripts to include the new console log replacement utility

### Remaining Tasks:

- Run the console log replacement script across the codebase
- Fix any remaining ESLint issues
- Implement consistent error logging patterns in remaining code
- Update documentation with logging best practices
