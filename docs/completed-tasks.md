# Completed Tasks

## Task #1: Project Foundation Setup

**Status:** Completed

### Implementation Overview:

This task involved setting up the TypeScript project structure with Express server, MongoDB connection, and basic middleware configuration. The following components were implemented:

1. **Configuration**:
   - Created a robust configuration system in `src/config/config.ts` that loads from environment variables
   - Implemented environment variable validation with detailed error reporting
   - Added support for different environments (development, production)

2. **Database Connection**:
   - Implemented a dedicated database utility in `src/utils/db.util.ts`
   - Added robust error handling for MongoDB connections
   - Configured proper connection options and event listeners
   - Added connection string masking for security

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Created standardized error types in `src/utils/error-types.util.ts`
   - Implemented a comprehensive error-handling middleware in `src/middlewares/error.middleware.ts`
   - Added standardized API responses via `src/utils/api-response.util.ts`

4. **Application Structure**:
   - Modified `src/app.ts` to use the improved error handling and database connection
   - Updated `src/bin/www.ts` for better server initialization
   - Implemented parallel processing of setup functions for improved startup performance

## Task #2: Authentication System Implementation

**Status:** Completed

### Implementation Overview:

This task involved enhancing the authentication system with JWT tokens, refresh tokens, and robust user profile management. The following components were implemented:

1. **Token Management**:
   - Enhanced `src/helpers/Jwt.ts` with refresh token generation and validation
   - Added token versioning to invalidate tokens during password changes/logouts
   - Added error handling and logging to token functions

2. **User Model Enhancement**:
   - Added tokenVersion field to the User model for refresh token management
   - Updated user interfaces for better TypeScript typing

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Added refresh token endpoint for token renewal
   - Created token revocation endpoint for security
   - Implemented profile management endpoints (view, update, change password)
   - Updated existing login endpoints to return refresh tokens

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added refresh token configuration to environment variables
   - Updated example configuration

5. **Testing Framework**:
   - Set up Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for authentication in `tests/unit/authentication.test.ts`
   - Added middleware tests in `tests/unit/auth-middleware.test.ts`
   - Configured package.json with test commands and Jest configuration

### Security Features Implemented:

- Token versioning to invalidate all tokens on sensitive actions
- Separate access and refresh token secrets and lifetimes
- Role-based access control for all endpoints
- Password strength validation
- Automatic token invalidation during password changes

## Task #11: Fix Linting Issues and Implement Consistent Error Logging Strategy (In Progress)

**Status:** In Progress

### Implementation Overview:

This task involves addressing linting issues and implementing a proper error logging strategy. The following progress has been made:

1. **Console Replacement Script**:
   - Created a specialized script in `scripts/fix-console-logs.js` to replace console.log statements with logger calls
   - Script intelligently adds Logger imports and creates logger instances where needed
   - Added support for different log levels (info, warn, error)

2. **Script Configuration**:
   - Added ESLint configuration for scripts in `scripts/.eslintrc.json` to properly handle Node.js environment
   - Updated package.json scripts to include the new console log replacement utility

### Remaining Tasks:

- Run the console log replacement script across the codebase
- Fix any remaining ESLint issues
- Implement consistent error logging patterns in remaining code
- Update documentation with logging best practices
