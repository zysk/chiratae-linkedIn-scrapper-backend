# LinkedIn Profile Scraper Backend

This TypeScript-based backend service provides functionality to scrape LinkedIn profiles and extract structured data.

## Features

- ü§ñ Automated LinkedIn profile data extraction
- üìä Structured data format for all profile sections
- üõ°Ô∏è Robust error handling and recovery
- üîÑ Automatic selector verification and optimization
- üìù Comprehensive logging

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update):
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Selector Verification

The LinkedIn scraper includes a built-in selector verification system that helps ensure reliable data extraction despite LinkedIn's frequent UI changes.

### How It Works

1. The `SelectorVerifier` class tracks the success/failure rate of each CSS selector
2. Multiple selectors are attempted for each data field, with statistics tracked on which ones work
3. The scraper self-optimizes by prioritizing selectors with higher success rates
4. Health metrics are generated to identify selectors that need maintenance

### Verifying Selectors

To test selectors against a real LinkedIn profile and generate health metrics:

```bash
# Run the verification tool
npm run verify-selectors -- --url <linkedin-profile-url> --output ./metrics.json

# For verbose output
npm run verify-selectors -- --url <linkedin-profile-url> --verbose
```

### Updating Selectors

When LinkedIn updates their UI, you can use the selector update tool to identify and fix selectors that no longer work:

```bash
# Analyze health metrics and update selectors interactively
npm run update-selectors -- --input ./metrics.json --threshold 0.3

# Focus on a specific category of selectors
npm run update-selectors -- --input ./metrics.json --category "Recommendations"
```

The tool will:
1. Identify poorly performing selectors based on the threshold
2. Show examples of working selectors for reference
3. Let you interactively decide which selectors to replace or remove
4. Provide guidance on where to update the code

### Interpreting Health Metrics

The health metrics file contains information about each selector:

- `successRate`: percentage of successful selector usages (higher is better)
- `successCount`: number of times the selector found valid data
- `failureCount`: number of times the selector failed
- `lastText`: sample of the last extracted text (helpful for debugging)

Selectors with low success rates may need updating to match LinkedIn's current UI.
