| Users | 8 | ✅ PASS |
| LinkedIn Accounts | 1 | ✅ PASS |
| Proxies | 1 | ✅ PASS |
| Campaigns | 1 | ✅ PASS |

## Performance Notes
- All API endpoints respond within acceptable timeframes (< 500ms)
- Authentication flow works correctly with token-based approach
- Error handling is consistent across endpoints

## Security Checks
- Password encryption is working as expected
- JWT-based authentication is correctly implemented
- Role-based access control is functioning correctly
- Unauthorized access is properly prevented

## Conclusion
The LinkedIn Scraper API has passed all the test scenarios. The authentication system, LinkedIn account management, proxy management, user rating system, and campaign management functionalities are all working as expected. The database is correctly storing all the necessary information and the API endpoints are performing within acceptable parameters.

## Recommendations
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling tests
- Add performance tests for larger datasets
- Consider adding integration tests with actual LinkedIn scraping
