# Task ID: 6
# Title: LinkedIn Search Automation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced LinkedIn search functionality with intelligent navigation, comprehensive filtering, and robust error handling.
# Details:
1. Develop a search execution service that supports all required search filters, including company size, industry, job title, location, years of experience, and more, as specified in the PRD.
2. Implement a feature to save search filters and create reusable search templates for efficient future use.
3. Ensure the search automation can handle LinkedIn's search result limits and pagination properly, with seamless navigation through all available results.
4. Incorporate error recovery mechanisms to gracefully handle interrupted searches, allowing users to resume from the last successful step.
5. Implement a metrics tracking system to gather insights on search operations, such as success rates, time taken, and any errors encountered.
6. Integrate the search automation with the multi-account system from Task 5 to enable cross-account search capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the search execution service supports all required filters and that search results accurately reflect the applied filters.
2. Test the search filter saving and template creation functionality, ensuring users can easily reuse and modify their preferred search configurations.
3. Validate the pagination handling by executing searches with varying result sizes and verifying that all results are properly retrieved.
4. Simulate interrupted searches and ensure the error recovery mechanism allows users to resume from the last successful step.
5. Monitor the metrics tracking system and validate the accuracy and completeness of the collected data.
6. Integrate the search automation with the multi-account system and verify seamless cross-account search capabilities.

### Description: Implement a service that executes LinkedIn searches, handles pagination, and manages search result limits.
### Details:
1. Create a SearchExecutionService that performs searches based on provided parameters.\n2. Implement pagination logic to navigate through search results beyond the first page.\n3. Handle LinkedIn's search result limits by tracking remaining searches and implementing appropriate waiting periods.\n4. Add intelligent waiting between actions to mimic human behavior and avoid detection.\n5. Implement error handling for various search-related failures like network issues or LinkedIn UI changes.

## 3. Build result extraction and profile URL storage system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create a system to extract profile information from search results and store profile URLs for later processing.
### Details:
1. Implement selectors with fallbacks for extracting profile information from LinkedIn search results.\n2. Create a ProfileUrlExtractor class that extracts profile URLs from search results.\n3. Implement a storage mechanism for saving extracted profile URLs with their associated campaign.\n4. Add deduplication logic to avoid extracting previously processed profiles.\n5. Create a queue system for scheduling profile URL processing based on priority and campaign settings.

## 4. Implement error recovery for interrupted searches [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Develop mechanisms to handle and recover from interrupted LinkedIn searches, including session expiration and network issues.
### Details:
1. Create a search state persistence system that regularly saves the current search state.\n2. Implement recovery mechanisms to resume searches from the last known state after interruptions.\n3. Add logic to detect session expiration and automatically re-authenticate when needed.\n4. Develop retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling transient network errors.\n5. Implement logging for search interruptions to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## 5. Create search templates and reusable filters [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build functionality to save search filters as templates and create reusable search configurations.
### Details:
1. Design and implement a SearchTemplate model to store reusable search configurations.\n2. Create CRUD operations for managing search templates.\n3. Implement a template selection mechanism in the search execution service.\n4. Add UI endpoints for template management and selection.\n5. Develop template inheritance or composition to allow building new templates from existing ones.

## 6. Implement search metrics and tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create a system to track and report on search operations, including performance, results, and rate limits.
### Details:
1. Design and implement a SearchMetrics model to store information about search operations.\n2. Track key metrics including search duration, results count, success rate, and rate limit usage.\n3. Create aggregation functions to generate reports on search performance by campaign, account, or time period.\n4. Implement real-time monitoring for search operations to detect issues early.\n5. Add endpoints for retrieving search metrics and generating reports.

## 7. Build multi-account search coordination [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.6, 6.4
### Description: Develop functionality to coordinate searches across multiple LinkedIn accounts to maximize efficiency and respect account limits.
### Details:
1. Integrate with the multi-account system from Task 5 to access and manage multiple LinkedIn accounts.\n2. Implement an account selection algorithm that chooses the optimal account for each search based on usage, health, and other factors.\n3. Create a load balancing system to distribute search operations across available accounts.\n4. Develop rate limiting mechanisms to ensure each account stays within LinkedIn's usage limits.\n5. Implement fallback logic to handle scenarios where an account becomes unavailable during a search operation.
