# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix Linting Issues and Implement Consistent Error Logging Strategy
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Address linting issues identified by 'npm run lint:fix' including console statements, unused variables, and explicit any types, while implementing a proper error logging strategy.
# Details:
This task involves several steps to improve code quality:

1. ESLint Configuration:
   - Review and update the existing ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.js` or create one if it doesn't exist
   - Configure rules to prohibit console statements (`no-console`)
   - Enable rules for unused variables (`no-unused-vars`)
   - Configure TypeScript-specific rules to prevent `any` types (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`)
   - Add appropriate exceptions where necessary

2. Fix Identified Issues:
   - Run `npm run lint:fix` to identify all linting issues
   - Remove all `console.log`, `console.error`, etc. statements from the codebase
   - Remove or utilize all unused variables
   - Replace all explicit `any` types with proper type definitions

3. Implement Error Logging Strategy:
   - Create a centralized logging service/utility that can be imported throughout the codebase
   - Implement different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Configure the logger to output to appropriate channels based on the environment (development, testing, production)
   - For production, ensure logs are properly formatted for log aggregation services
   - Add context information to logs (e.g., timestamp, component/file name, user info if applicable)

4. Replace Console Statements:
   - Replace all console statements with the new logging utility
   - Ensure proper log levels are used based on the context
   - Add meaningful error messages and context information

5. Documentation:
   - Document the new logging approach in the project README or wiki
   - Provide examples of proper logging usage for other developers

# Test Strategy:
To verify this task has been correctly implemented:

1. Linting Verification:
   - Run `npm run lint` (without fix) and confirm no linting errors related to console statements, unused variables, or any types
   - Verify this on a clean build to ensure all files are checked
   - Run the check in CI pipeline to ensure it passes

2. Code Review:
   - Perform a thorough code review to ensure all console statements have been replaced with the logging utility
   - Verify that all previously unused variables are now either used or removed
   - Check that explicit any types have been replaced with proper types

3. Logging Implementation Testing:
   - Write unit tests for the logging utility to ensure it functions correctly
   - Test each log level to verify correct behavior
   - Mock the output channels to verify logs are sent to the correct destinations
   - Test environment-specific behavior (dev vs prod logging)

4. Integration Testing:
   - Trigger various error conditions in the application and verify they are properly logged
   - Check that log messages contain appropriate context information
   - Verify that sensitive information is not being logged

5. Performance Testing:
   - Ensure the logging implementation doesn't significantly impact application performance
   - Test with high volume of logs to verify performance under load
