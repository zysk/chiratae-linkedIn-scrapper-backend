# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the TypeScript project structure with Express server, MongoDB connection, and basic middleware configuration.
# Details:
Initialize a TypeScript Node.js project with Express.js framework. Configure tsconfig.json for strict type checking. Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose ODM with proper error handling. Implement global error middleware with specialized error types and consistent error responses. Create a configuration service for environment variables management. Establish project folder structure following MVC pattern with separate directories for models, controllers, routes, services, middleware, utils, and types.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for database connection, configuration loading, and error handling middleware. Implement integration tests for basic server functionality. Verify proper TypeScript compilation and project structure.
