# Title: Fix Linting Issues and Configure ChromeDriver Path
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Fix TypeScript linting warnings and configure ChromeDriver to use the correct executables based on the operating system.
# Details:
1. Fix TypeScript linting warnings including: usage of `any` type throughout the codebase, unnecessary console statements, unused variables, self-assignment issues, and ES2015 namespaces.
2. Configure Selenium WebDriver to detect operating system and use the appropriate ChromeDriver executable: use chromedriver/chromedriver-win64/chromedriver.exe for Windows development and chromedriver/chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver for Linux production. Update the `createWebDriver` function in app.ts to set the service builder path dynamically based on the OS.

# Test Strategy:
Run `npm run lint:fix` to verify linting fixes. Test Selenium WebDriver initialization on both Windows and Linux environments to ensure the correct ChromeDriver is used.
