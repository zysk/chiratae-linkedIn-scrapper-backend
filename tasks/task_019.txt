# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Comprehensive User Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a complete user management system with role-based access control, profile management, organizational structure, security features, and user activity tracking.
# Details:
Create a modular user management system with the following components:

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Implement at least 4 user roles: Admin, Manager, Regular User, and Read-Only User
   - Create a permissions framework that allows granular control over system features
   - Design role inheritance where appropriate (e.g., Admin inherits all permissions)
   - Implement a UI for administrators to manage roles and assign permissions

2. User Profile Management:
   - Create editable user profiles with personal information, contact details, and profile pictures
   - Implement user preferences for interface customization, notifications, and privacy settings
   - Add account settings for email, password changes, and two-factor authentication setup

3. Team/Organization Structure:
   - Design a hierarchical organization model with departments and teams
   - Implement user-to-team assignments with specific roles within teams
   - Create interfaces for organization admins to manage the structure
   - Add team-specific dashboards and communication channels

4. Activity Tracking and Audit Logs:
   - Log all significant user actions (login/logout, data modifications, permission changes)
   - Create a searchable and filterable audit log interface for administrators
   - Implement data retention policies for logs
   - Add export functionality for compliance reporting

5. Security Features:
   - Implement password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, expiration)
   - Add account lockout after failed login attempts
   - Create password reset workflows with secure verification
   - Implement session management with timeout settings

6. Notification System:
   - Create user-configurable notification preferences (email, in-app, mobile)
   - Implement notification categories and importance levels
   - Add notification history and management interface

7. User Dashboard:
   - Design a customizable dashboard with draggable widgets
   - Create role-specific default dashboards
   - Implement dashboard settings persistence

8. Onboarding System:
   - Create a step-by-step onboarding workflow for new users
   - Implement interactive tutorials for key features
   - Add a knowledge base with searchable help articles
   - Create role-specific training materials

Use a secure authentication framework and ensure all user data is properly encrypted. Follow GDPR and other relevant privacy regulations for data handling.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the user management system:

1. Role and Permission Testing:
   - Verify each role has the correct permissions by attempting actions with different user accounts
   - Test permission inheritance and overrides
   - Verify UI elements are properly shown/hidden based on permissions
   - Test role assignment and removal functionality

2. Profile Management Testing:
   - Verify all profile fields can be edited and saved correctly
   - Test validation for required fields and format requirements
   - Verify preference changes are applied immediately and persist across sessions
   - Test profile picture upload, cropping, and display

3. Organization Structure Testing:
   - Test creation, editing, and deletion of departments and teams
   - Verify user assignments to multiple teams work correctly
   - Test hierarchical relationships and permissions within the organization
   - Verify team dashboards show correct information

4. Audit and Activity Testing:
   - Verify all specified actions are properly logged
   - Test filtering and searching in the audit log
   - Verify log retention policies are enforced
   - Test export functionality for various formats

5. Security Testing:
   - Test password policies are enforced during creation and changes
   - Verify account lockout works after specified failed attempts
   - Test password reset workflow end-to-end
   - Verify session timeout and forced logout functionality

6. Notification Testing:
   - Test each notification delivery method works correctly
   - Verify preference changes affect notification delivery
   - Test notification history and management

7. Dashboard Testing:
   - Verify dashboard customization works and persists
   - Test widget functionality and data display
   - Verify role-specific dashboards are applied correctly

8. Onboarding Testing:
   - Test the complete onboarding flow for different user roles
   - Verify tutorials work correctly and can be completed
   - Test knowledge base search functionality

Additional Testing:
- Performance testing with large numbers of users and complex organization structures
- Security testing including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- Accessibility testing to ensure compliance with WCAG standards
- Cross-browser and responsive design testing
- Integration testing with other system components
