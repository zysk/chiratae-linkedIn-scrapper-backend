# Task ID: 8
# Title: Lead Management and Annotation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive lead management system with support for custom statuses, assignment, filtering, annotation, activity logging, bulk operations, prioritization, and export/merge capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create Lead model with fields for scraped profile data, custom status, assignment, and relationship to campaigns.
2. Implement Lead Status model for defining and managing custom status definitions aligned with sales workflows.
3. Develop CRUD operations for leads with validation, including support for bulk lead creation, update, and deletion.
4. Build lead assignment functionality to assign leads to users for follow-up actions.
5. Create lead filtering and sorting capabilities based on various criteria such as status, assigned user, campaign, and custom fields.
6. Implement Lead Comments model and functionality for adding notes and annotations to leads.
7. Develop activity logging to track all interactions and status changes for each lead.
8. Implement lead prioritization mechanisms based on configurable criteria such as lead score, engagement, or custom business rules.
9. Build lead export functionality to allow users to export lead data in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).
10. Implement lead merging capabilities to handle duplicate lead entries.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test lead creation from scraped profile data and bulk lead management operations.
2. Verify custom status tracking and transitions aligned with sales workflows.
3. Test lead assignment functionality and ensure proper follow-up actions.
4. Validate lead filtering, sorting, and prioritization capabilities.
5. Test the lead annotation system and activity logging for all interactions.
6. Ensure lead export functionality works as expected in various formats.
7. Test lead merging capabilities to handle duplicate entries.

### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build lead assignment functionality that allows leads to be assigned to users for follow-up actions.
### Details:
1. Update the Lead model to include assignment information (assigned user, assignment date, etc.).\n2. Create API endpoints for assigning leads to users and for users to claim leads.\n3. Implement automatic assignment features based on configurable rules (round-robin, skill-based, etc.).\n4. Add notification mechanisms for users when leads are assigned to them.\n5. Implement reporting on lead assignment statistics (assignments per user, response times, etc.).

## 4. Create Lead Filtering and Sorting Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive filtering and sorting capabilities for leads based on various criteria.
### Details:
1. Design and implement a query builder for complex lead filtering based on multiple criteria.\n2. Create API endpoints that support filtering leads by status, assignment, campaign, date ranges, and profile attributes.\n3. Implement sorting functionality by various fields (name, date added, status, priority, etc.).\n4. Add pagination support for large result sets.\n5. Create a saved filter feature allowing users to save and reuse common filters.

## 5. Develop Lead Annotation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement a robust annotation system for adding notes and comments to leads.
### Details:
1. Create a LeadComment model for storing notes and comments associated with leads.\n2. Implement CRUD operations for lead comments with proper validation.\n3. Add support for rich text formatting in comments.\n4. Implement comment threading to allow for organized discussions about leads.\n5. Create API endpoints for managing lead comments and retrieving comment history.

## 6. Implement Activity Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Develop activity logging functionality to track all interactions and changes to leads.
### Details:
1. Create a LeadActivityLog model for tracking all actions and changes related to leads.\n2. Implement hooks or middleware to automatically log activities when leads are created, updated, or have status changes.\n3. Record user information, timestamp, and detailed change information for each activity.\n4. Create API endpoints for retrieving lead activity history with filtering options.\n5. Implement a dashboard for viewing recent lead activities across the system.

## 7. Build Bulk Lead Management Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement functionality for performing operations on multiple leads simultaneously.
### Details:
1. Create API endpoints for bulk operations such as status updates, assignments, and deletion.\n2. Implement a selection mechanism for users to choose multiple leads for bulk operations.\n3. Add validation to ensure bulk operations are only performed on valid leads and with appropriate user permissions.\n4. Implement progress tracking for long-running bulk operations.\n5. Create a transaction system to ensure bulk operations are atomic (all succeed or all fail).

## 8. Implement Lead Export and Merging [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.4
