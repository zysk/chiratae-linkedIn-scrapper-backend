# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement CRUD APIs for managing LinkedIn accounts and proxies, with secure password handling for LinkedIn accounts.
# Details:
Create controllers and routes (`linkedInAccount.*`, `proxy.*`). Implement CRUD operations. **Implement the TODOs for password encryption in the LinkedIn Account controller** using the Encryption helper. Include placeholders for validation/verification logic (e.g., checking proxy validity). Ensure only admins or owners can manage.

# Test Strategy:
API integration tests for CRUD operations on LinkedIn accounts and proxies, checking authorization. Verify LinkedIn account passwords are stored securely (encrypted).
