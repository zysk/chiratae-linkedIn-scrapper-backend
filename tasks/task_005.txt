# Task ID: 5
# Title: Selenium Integration and Browser Automation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Selenium WebDriver with proxy support, implement LinkedIn authentication handling, and create browser automation utilities.
# Details:
1. Create a Selenium service for WebDriver initialization
2. Implement platform detection for appropriate chromedriver selection
3. Add proxy integration with Selenium
4. Create headless browser configuration
5. Implement LinkedIn login flow
6. Add CAPTCHA detection and handling
7. Implement OTP verification flow
8. Create session management utilities
9. Add random delays and anti-detection measures
10. Implement browser cleanup and resource management
11. Create API endpoints for handling login challenges (/campaign/linkedInLogin, /campaign/checkLinkedInLogin, /campaign/getLinkedInCaptcha, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
1. Test WebDriver initialization with different configurations
2. Verify proxy integration works correctly
3. Test login flow with test accounts
4. Verify CAPTCHA detection
5. Test browser cleanup and resource management

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Selenium WebDriver [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Selenium service for WebDriver initialization and implement platform detection for appropriate chromedriver selection.
### Details:
1. Install Selenium WebDriver and chromedriver libraries in the project.
2. Create a Selenium service class to handle WebDriver initialization.
3. Implement logic to detect the operating system and select the appropriate chromedriver executable.

## 2. Integrate Proxy Support [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add proxy integration with Selenium WebDriver.
### Details:
1. Identify the proxy server details (host, port, username, password).
2. Modify the Selenium service to accept proxy configurations.
3. Set the proxy settings in the WebDriver instance.

## 3. Implement Headless Browser Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a headless browser configuration for Selenium WebDriver.
### Details:
1. Investigate the headless mode capabilities of the chromedriver.
2. Modify the Selenium service to create a headless WebDriver instance.
3. Ensure the headless configuration works as expected.

## 4. Implement LinkedIn Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Implement the LinkedIn login flow using Selenium WebDriver.
### Details:
1. Identify the LinkedIn login page elements (username, password, submit button).
2. Write the login flow logic to enter the credentials and submit the form.
3. Handle any potential challenges like CAPTCHA or OTP verification.

## 5. Implement CAPTCHA Detection and Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Add CAPTCHA detection and handling capabilities to the LinkedIn authentication flow.
### Details:
1. Detect the presence of a CAPTCHA challenge on the LinkedIn login page.
2. Implement a mechanism to capture the CAPTCHA image and present it to the user for manual solving.
3. Update the login flow to handle the CAPTCHA response and proceed with the authentication.

## 6. Implement OTP Verification Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement the OTP verification flow for LinkedIn authentication.
### Details:
1. Detect the presence of an OTP verification step during the LinkedIn login.
2. Prompt the user to enter the OTP code received on their registered device.
3. Integrate the OTP verification into the overall LinkedIn authentication flow.

## 7. Implement Browser Automation Utilities [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Create session management utilities, add random delays and anti-detection measures, and implement browser cleanup and resource management.
### Details:
1. Implement session management utilities to maintain and reuse WebDriver instances.
2. Add random delays at appropriate points in the automation flow to mimic human-like behavior.
3. Implement anti-detection measures like user-agent rotation, IP rotation, and other techniques to avoid triggering bot detection.
4. Ensure proper cleanup of WebDriver instances and release of resources upon completion of the automation tasks.
