# Task ID: 5
# Title: Selenium Integration and LinkedIn Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Selenium WebDriver with proxy support and implement LinkedIn authentication handling.
# Details:
Set up Selenium WebDriver with TypeScript bindings. Implement WebDriver factory with proxy integration. Create a browser session manager for handling cookies and state. Develop LinkedIn authentication service that handles login flow, CAPTCHA challenges, and OTP verification. Implement session management for maintaining authenticated state. Build anti-detection measures including random delays and browser fingerprint masking. Create recovery mechanisms for handling authentication failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebDriver initialization with different proxy configurations. Verify LinkedIn authentication process with error handling. Test CAPTCHA and OTP handling mechanisms. Validate session management and cookie handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Selenium WebDriver with TypeScript bindings [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure Selenium WebDriver with TypeScript support. Ensure the necessary dependencies are added to the project.
### Details:
1. Install Selenium WebDriver and TypeScript packages using npm or yarn.
2. Create a new TypeScript file for the WebDriver setup and configuration.
3. Initialize the WebDriver instance using the appropriate browser-specific driver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver).
4. Ensure the WebDriver instance can be imported and used throughout the codebase.

## 2. Implement WebDriver factory with proxy integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a WebDriver factory that can handle proxy configurations and return a new WebDriver instance with the specified proxy settings.
### Details:
1. Create a WebDriverFactory class that encapsulates the WebDriver initialization logic.
2. Add support for proxy configuration, allowing the factory to create WebDriver instances with the specified proxy settings.
3. Implement methods to set proxy host, port, username, and password.
4. Ensure the factory can handle both Windows and Linux environments by using the appropriate chromedriver binaries.

## 3. Develop LinkedIn authentication service [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Implement a LinkedIn authentication service that handles the login flow, CAPTCHA challenges, and OTP verification.
### Details:
1. Create a LinkedInAuthService class that encapsulates the authentication logic.
2. Implement methods to handle the login flow, including username and password input, and submission of the login form.
3. Detect and handle CAPTCHA challenges, either by providing a manual solution or integrating with a CAPTCHA solving service.
4. Implement OTP verification, allowing the user to input the one-time password and complete the authentication process.
5. Ensure the service can handle various authentication scenarios, including failed logins and account lockouts.

## 4. Implement session management for maintaining authenticated state [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create a session manager to handle the storage and retrieval of authenticated user sessions, including cookies and other session-related data.
### Details:
1. Develop a SessionManager class to encapsulate session-related functionality.
2. Implement methods to save the current browser session, including cookies, localStorage, and other relevant data.
3. Provide a way to load a previously saved session, allowing the user to resume an authenticated state.
4. Ensure the session manager can handle session expiration and provide mechanisms for refreshing the session when necessary.

## 5. Implement anti-detection measures and recovery mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Add anti-detection measures, including random delays and browser fingerprint masking, and create recovery mechanisms for handling authentication failures.
### Details:
1. Implement random delays between actions to mimic human-like behavior and avoid detection by LinkedIn's anti-bot measures.
2. Develop a browser fingerprint masking system to obfuscate the WebDriver's unique characteristics and make it appear more like a regular browser.
3. Create recovery mechanisms to handle authentication failures, such as retrying the login process, adjusting proxy settings, or providing alternative authentication methods.
4. Ensure the anti-detection and recovery mechanisms are integrated throughout the codebase, including the WebDriver factory, authentication service, and session manager.
