# Task ID: 5
# Title: Selenium Integration and LinkedIn Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Selenium WebDriver with proxy support, headless mode, and robust error handling to implement a comprehensive LinkedIn authentication solution with advanced security measures and multi-account management.
# Details:
Set up Selenium WebDriver with TypeScript bindings, including support for headless mode operation. Implement a WebDriver factory with proxy integration and error handling for network issues and LinkedIn UI changes. Develop a LinkedIn authentication service that can handle login flow, CAPTCHA challenges, phone verification, and unusual login detection. Create a session management system for maintaining authenticated state across multiple LinkedIn accounts. Build anti-detection measures including random delays and browser fingerprint masking. Implement recovery mechanisms for handling authentication failures and monitoring account health to prevent account restrictions.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebDriver initialization with different proxy configurations and in headless mode. Verify LinkedIn authentication process with comprehensive error handling. Validate CAPTCHA, phone verification, and unusual login detection handling. Test session management and cookie handling for multiple accounts. Ensure anti-detection measures and recovery mechanisms work as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Selenium WebDriver with TypeScript support and headless mode [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Selenium WebDriver into the project, setting up the necessary TypeScript bindings and configuration to enable headless mode operation.
### Details:
1. Install Selenium WebDriver and TypeScript dependencies in the project.
2. Create a WebDriver configuration file that sets up the WebDriver instance with options for headless mode, browser selection, and other necessary settings.
3. Implement a WebDriver factory function that returns a configured WebDriver instance based on the settings in the configuration file.
4. Write unit tests to ensure the WebDriver factory is working as expected, including verifying headless mode operation.

## 2. Implement a WebDriver factory with proxy integration and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop a WebDriver factory that can handle proxy configurations and robust error handling for network issues and LinkedIn UI changes.
### Details:
1. Extend the WebDriver factory to accept proxy configuration options, such as host, port, and authentication credentials.
2. Implement logic to configure the WebDriver instance with the provided proxy settings.
3. Add error handling mechanisms to the WebDriver factory to gracefully handle network errors, such as connection timeouts and SSL/TLS issues.
4. Implement a system to monitor LinkedIn UI changes and update the WebDriver factory accordingly to handle any breaking changes.
5. Write integration tests to validate the WebDriver factory's proxy integration and error handling capabilities.

## 3. Develop a LinkedIn authentication service [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a LinkedIn authentication service that can handle the login flow, CAPTCHA challenges, phone verification, and unusual login detection.
### Details:
1. Implement a LinkedIn authentication service that encapsulates the login flow, including username and password submission, CAPTCHA handling, and phone verification.
2. Develop mechanisms to detect and handle unusual login attempts, such as IP address changes or suspicious activity, and trigger appropriate actions (e.g., account lockout, email notification).
3. Integrate the authentication service with the WebDriver factory to leverage the configured WebDriver instance for performing login operations.
4. Implement recovery mechanisms to handle authentication failures, such as retrying the login process or providing alternative authentication methods.
5. Write integration tests to validate the LinkedIn authentication service's functionality, including successful logins, CAPTCHA handling, and unusual login detection.

## 4. Implement a session management system for multi-account support [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Create a session management system that can maintain authenticated state across multiple LinkedIn accounts.
### Details:
1. Design a session management system that can store and retrieve authenticated session data for multiple LinkedIn accounts.
2. Implement mechanisms to securely store and retrieve session data, such as using encrypted storage or a secure database.
3. Develop methods to initialize a new session, load an existing session, and invalidate a session when necessary.
4. Integrate the session management system with the LinkedIn authentication service to seamlessly handle account switching and session restoration.
5. Write integration tests to validate the session management system's functionality, including successful session creation, loading, and invalidation.

## 5. Implement anti-detection measures and account health monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Develop anti-detection measures, including random delays and browser fingerprint masking, and implement account health monitoring to prevent account restrictions.
### Details:
1. Implement random delay mechanisms to introduce natural-looking pauses between actions, mimicking human-like behavior and reducing the risk of detection.
2. Develop browser fingerprint masking techniques to obfuscate the WebDriver instance's unique characteristics, making it appear more like a regular browser.
3. Implement an account health monitoring system that tracks key metrics, such as login success rate, CAPTCHA challenges, and unusual activity flags, to proactively detect and prevent account restrictions.
4. Integrate the anti-detection measures and account health monitoring system with the overall LinkedIn authentication and session management components.
5. Write integration tests to validate the effectiveness of the anti-detection measures and the account health monitoring system, ensuring they work as expected and do not interfere with the core functionality.
