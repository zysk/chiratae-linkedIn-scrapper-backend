Create User model with Mongoose including fields for authentication details, role, profile information, and activity metrics. Implement password hashing using bcrypt. Develop JWT authentication middleware for token generation, validation, and refresh. Build registration, login, and token refresh endpoints. Implement role-based authorization middleware to restrict access based on user roles. Create user profile management endpoints for updating user information.
