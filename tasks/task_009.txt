# Task ID: 9
# Title: Scheduling System with Redis Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive campaign scheduling system with Redis integration, supporting distributed locking, cron-based scheduling, error recovery, job monitoring, and integration with LinkedIn search and email campaigns.
# Details:
1. Set up Redis integration for distributed locking to prevent concurrent execution of the same campaign.
2. Implement detailed cron-based scheduling for different campaign components, including LinkedIn search and email campaigns.
3. Develop robust error recovery and retry mechanisms to handle failed jobs.
4. Add job monitoring and status reporting capabilities to the scheduling system.
5. Ensure the scheduling system integrates seamlessly with both LinkedIn search and email campaign workflows.
6. Implement configurable rate limiting to prevent detection by platforms.
7. Add support for scheduling based on various factors like time zones, account usage, and other relevant parameters.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify distributed locking with Redis under concurrent campaign execution scenarios.
2. Test cron-based scheduling with various timing configurations for different campaign components.
3. Validate error recovery mechanisms by simulating job failures and ensuring successful retries.
4. Inspect job monitoring and status reporting to ensure accurate and timely information.
5. End-to-end test the integration with LinkedIn search and email campaign systems.
6. Confirm rate limiting is working as expected and does not impact campaign execution.
7. Test scheduling based on different parameters like time zones and account usage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Redis Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Redis into the application to enable distributed locking and caching capabilities.
### Details:
1. Install and configure Redis on the server.
2. Integrate Redis client library into the application code.
3. Implement distributed locking mechanism using Redis to prevent concurrent execution of the same campaign.
4. Utilize Redis for caching campaign data and job status information to improve performance.

## 2. Implement Cron-based Scheduling [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop a cron-based scheduling system to manage the execution of different campaign components.
### Details:
1. Design a scheduling engine that can handle cron-based scheduling for LinkedIn search and email campaigns.
2. Implement a scheduling service that can parse cron expressions and trigger the execution of campaign tasks at the appropriate times.
3. Ensure the scheduling service can handle time zone differences and other relevant scheduling parameters.

## 3. Implement Error Recovery and Retry Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop a robust error recovery and retry mechanism to handle failed campaign jobs.
### Details:
1. Implement a job execution monitoring system to track the status of campaign tasks.
2. Develop a retry mechanism that can automatically re-execute failed jobs after a configurable delay.
3. Implement error handling and logging to capture detailed information about job failures.
4. Ensure the retry mechanism can handle different types of errors and gracefully recover from failures.

## 4. Implement Job Monitoring and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Add job monitoring and status reporting capabilities to the scheduling system.
### Details:
1. Develop a dashboard or reporting interface to display the status of scheduled campaigns and their individual tasks.
2. Implement real-time job monitoring to track the progress and execution of campaign tasks.
3. Provide detailed job logs and error reports to help identify and troubleshoot issues.
4. Allow users to view the execution history and performance metrics of past campaigns.

## 5. Integrate with LinkedIn Search and Email Campaigns [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Ensure the scheduling system seamlessly integrates with LinkedIn search and email campaign workflows.
### Details:
1. Develop API integrations with LinkedIn's search and campaign management platforms.
2. Implement data synchronization mechanisms to keep the scheduling system up-to-date with campaign data from LinkedIn.
3. Ensure the scheduling system can trigger and monitor the execution of LinkedIn search and email campaigns.
4. Provide a unified interface for managing all campaign components within the scheduling system.

## 6. Implement Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Add configurable rate limiting to prevent detection by platforms.
### Details:
1. Analyze the rate limits and usage policies of the integrated platforms (LinkedIn, email providers).
2. Develop a rate limiting mechanism that can dynamically adjust the execution rate of campaign tasks based on platform policies.
3. Implement throttling and backoff strategies to ensure the scheduling system stays within the allowed usage limits.
4. Provide configuration options to allow users to customize the rate limiting parameters.

## 7. Implement Advanced Scheduling Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6
### Description: Add support for scheduling based on various factors like time zones, account usage, and other relevant parameters.
### Details:
1. Develop a scheduling engine that can handle time zone-based scheduling for campaigns.
2. Implement account-level usage tracking and scheduling policies to ensure fair distribution of campaign execution across user accounts.
3. Allow users to configure custom scheduling parameters, such as start/end times, recurrence patterns, and priority levels.
4. Integrate the scheduling system with other relevant data sources (e.g., user profiles, account usage) to enable more advanced scheduling logic.
