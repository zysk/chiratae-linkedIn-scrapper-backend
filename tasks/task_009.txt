# Task ID: 9
# Title: Scheduling System with Redis Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement campaign scheduling with distributed locking using Redis for concurrent execution control.
# Details:
Set up Redis integration for distributed locking. Implement node-schedule for cron-based execution of campaigns. Create a job scheduler service that manages campaign execution. Develop concurrency control to prevent multiple instances of the same campaign from running simultaneously. Build a queue system for campaign execution. Implement error recovery for failed jobs. Create monitoring endpoints for scheduled jobs. Develop campaign execution automation with configurable parameters.

# Test Strategy:
Test distributed locking with Redis under concurrent scenarios. Verify scheduled job execution with various timing configurations. Test error recovery mechanisms for failed jobs. Validate concurrency control for multiple campaigns.
