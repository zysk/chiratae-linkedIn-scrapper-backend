# Subtasks:
## 1. Create EmailSettings Model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data model for email settings, including SMTP server details, authentication credentials, and other configuration parameters.
### Details:

### Details:
1. Implement GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for the `EmailSettings` model.
2. Ensure the API is secured and only accessible to authorized users.
3. Integrate the email settings CRUD operations with the `EmailSettings` model created in the previous subtask.

## 3. Integrate Nodemailer for Email Sending [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Set up the Nodemailer library to enable sending emails from the application.
### Details:
1. Install the Nodemailer package and set up the necessary configuration.

3. Trigger the email service to send notifications when the critical events occur.
4. Ensure the email content is informative and includes relevant details about the event.

## 5. Add Email Sending Queue [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement a reliable email sending queue to handle email delivery failures and ensure message delivery.
### Details:
1. Integrate a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) to handle email sending requests.
