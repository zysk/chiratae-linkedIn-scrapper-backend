# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Security Measures in LinkedIn Scraper Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the LinkedIn scraper application with industry-standard security measures to protect credentials, prevent vulnerabilities, and ensure secure data handling throughout the application lifecycle.
# Details:
Implement the following security measures:

1. **Secure Credential Storage**:
   - Store LinkedIn and proxy credentials using environment variables or a secure vault solution (like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Never hardcode credentials in the codebase
   - Implement encryption for any credentials stored in configuration files

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing
   - Implement strict type checking and format validation
   - Use parameterized queries for any database operations

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and comply with LinkedIn's terms of service
   - Add exponential backoff for failed requests
   - Create a configurable delay between requests

4. **OWASP Top 10 Protection**:
   - Implement protection against injection attacks
   - Add Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
   - Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   - Secure deserialization of data
   - Implement proper session management

5. **Security Headers**:
   - Add Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Implement X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - Set X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
   - Add Strict-Transport-Security headers

6. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Implement proper authentication for accessing the scraper
   - Add role-based access controls if multiple user types exist
   - Ensure secure session management with proper timeout settings

7. **Secure Logging**:
   - Implement structured logging
   - Ensure no sensitive data (passwords, tokens, personal information) is logged
   - Add appropriate log levels and rotation policies
   - Include request IDs for traceability

8. **Dependency Scanning**:
   - Integrate a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk)
   - Set up automated scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Create a process for regular updates of dependencies

9. **Additional Measures**:
   - Implement HTTPS for all communications
   - Add request and response data validation
   - Create a security incident response plan

# Test Strategy:
Verify security implementation using the following tests:

1. **Credential Security Tests**:
   - Verify credentials are not present in the codebase using static code analysis
   - Test that the application fails securely when credentials are invalid
   - Confirm credentials are properly encrypted at rest

2. **Input Validation Tests**:
   - Perform fuzzing tests with malformed inputs
   - Test boundary conditions with extreme values
   - Attempt SQL injection and XSS attacks to verify protection

3. **Rate Limiting Tests**:
   - Verify rate limiting by sending rapid successive requests
   - Confirm backoff strategy works when LinkedIn returns 429 status codes
   - Test that configurable delays are respected

4. **Vulnerability Tests**:
   - Run OWASP ZAP or similar security scanning tools against the application
   - Perform penetration testing focusing on the OWASP Top 10
   - Use tools like Burp Suite to identify security issues

5. **Header Security Tests**:
   - Use tools like SecurityHeaders.com to verify proper header implementation
   - Test each security header is correctly configured

6. **Authentication Tests**:
   - Attempt to access protected resources without authentication
   - Test session timeout functionality
   - Verify role-based access controls work as expected

7. **Logging Tests**:
   - Review logs to ensure no sensitive data is recorded
   - Verify all security events are properly logged
   - Test log rotation and retention policies

8. **Dependency Tests**:
   - Run dependency scanners and verify no critical vulnerabilities exist
   - Test the update process for vulnerable dependencies

9. **Integration Tests**:
   - Perform end-to-end security testing in a staging environment
   - Create a security checklist and verify all items are addressed
   - Document any accepted risks with appropriate mitigations
