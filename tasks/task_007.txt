# Task ID: 7
# Title: Redis Integration and Scheduling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement Redis for distributed locking, set up the scheduling system for automated campaign execution, and create the cron job infrastructure.
# Details:
1. Set up Redis client connection
2. Implement distributed locking mechanism using Redis
3. Create concurrency control for scraping operations
4. Implement node-schedule for cron-based execution
5. Create scheduling service for campaign automation
6. Add campaign queue management
7. Implement error recovery for failed scheduled jobs
8. Create API endpoint for scheduling campaigns (/campaign/addScheduledCampaign)
9. Add state management for running campaigns
10. Implement system for handling campaign execution limits

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Redis connection and locking mechanism
2. Verify scheduled jobs execute correctly
3. Test concurrency control with multiple campaigns
4. Verify error recovery works as expected
5. Test campaign scheduling API

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Redis client connection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a connection to the Redis server and create a client instance that can be used throughout the application.
### Details:
1. Install the necessary Redis client library for the programming language being used (e.g., ioredis for Node.js, redis-py for Python).
2. Configure the Redis connection details (host, port, password, etc.) in the application's environment or configuration file.
3. Create a Redis client instance and test the connection to ensure it's working correctly.

## 2. Implement distributed locking mechanism using Redis [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop a locking mechanism that uses Redis to ensure mutual exclusion for critical sections of the application.
### Details:
1. Research and understand the concept of distributed locking and how it can be implemented using Redis.
2. Implement a locking function that uses the Redis `SET` command with the `NX` option to acquire a lock.
3. Implement a function to release the lock by using the Redis `DEL` command.
4. Ensure that the locking mechanism is robust and can handle edge cases, such as locks not being released due to application crashes or other failures.

## 3. Create concurrency control for scraping operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement a concurrency control system that uses the distributed locking mechanism to ensure that only one instance of a scraping operation is running at a time.
### Details:
1. Identify the critical sections of the scraping operations that need to be protected by the locking mechanism.
2. Implement a function that acquires a lock before executing a scraping operation and releases the lock when the operation is complete.
3. Ensure that the locking mechanism is integrated with the scraping logic to prevent race conditions and data inconsistencies.

## 4. Implement node-schedule for cron-based execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Set up a scheduling system using the node-schedule library to execute tasks on a recurring basis.
### Details:
1. Install the node-schedule library and add it to the project dependencies.
2. Create a function that uses the `schedule` method to schedule a task to run at a specific interval (e.g., every hour, every day).
3. Ensure that the scheduled tasks can be easily added, modified, and removed as needed.

## 5. Create scheduling service for campaign automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Develop a service that manages the scheduling and execution of automated campaigns.
### Details:
1. Design the data model and storage mechanism for campaign schedules and execution details.
2. Implement the logic to create, update, and delete campaign schedules.
3. Integrate the scheduling service with the node-schedule library to execute the campaigns at the specified intervals.
4. Ensure that the scheduling service can handle errors and retries for failed campaign executions.

## 6. Implement error recovery for failed scheduled jobs [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Develop a system to handle and recover from errors that occur during the execution of scheduled jobs.
### Details:
1. Implement a logging mechanism to capture detailed information about scheduled job executions, including any errors or failures.
2. Create a retry mechanism that automatically attempts to re-run failed jobs after a specified delay.
3. Implement a dead-letter queue or similar mechanism to store and process jobs that fail repeatedly and cannot be automatically recovered.
4. Develop a monitoring and alerting system to notify the team about recurring job failures or other issues with the scheduling system.
