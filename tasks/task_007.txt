# Task ID: 7
# Title: Profile Data Scraping and Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive profile data extraction, normalization, and storage functionality with de-duplication, connection degree determination, and handling of premium/restricted profiles.
# Details:
1. Create profile scraping service that extracts detailed information from LinkedIn profiles, including name, title, company, company size, industry, location, education, experience, skills, and contact information.
2. Implement support for determining connection degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for each profile.
3. Develop advanced data normalization to ensure consistent formatting across different profiles.
4. Add support for extracting data from both public and private profiles (when logged in).
5. Implement rate limiting and anti-detection measures specifically for profile viewing.
6. Add mechanisms to mark profiles as premium/Sales Navigator only when certain data can't be accessed.
7. Implement robust error handling for various profile states (incomplete, restricted, etc.).
8. Develop structured storage of profile data in the database with de-duplication logic to prevent re-scraping of profiles.
9. Create a service for tracking scraping progress and results.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test comprehensive profile data extraction with various profile types, including public and private profiles.
2. Verify data normalization and consistency across different profile formats.
3. Test de-duplication logic with existing profiles.
4. Validate connection degree determination for different profile relationships.
5. Test error handling for different failure scenarios during scraping, including incomplete and restricted profiles.
6. Verify rate limiting and anti-detection measures for profile viewing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Profile Scraping Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a service that can extract detailed information from LinkedIn profiles, including name, title, company, company size, industry, location, education, experience, skills, and contact information.
### Details:
1. Research and select the appropriate web scraping library or tool to use for extracting data from LinkedIn profiles.
2. Implement the scraping logic to fetch the required data fields from public LinkedIn profiles.
3. Ensure the scraping process is efficient and does not violate LinkedIn's terms of service.
4. Implement error handling to gracefully handle various profile states (incomplete, restricted, etc.).
5. Test the scraping service thoroughly to ensure it can handle a wide range of profile scenarios.

## 2. Determine Connection Degree [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement functionality to determine the connection degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd) for each profile.
### Details:
1. Analyze the data extracted from the profiles to identify the connection degree for each profile.
2. Implement logic to determine the connection degree based on the available information, such as shared connections, mutual followers, etc.
3. Ensure the connection degree determination is accurate and consistent across all profiles.

## 3. Implement Data Normalization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop advanced data normalization to ensure consistent formatting across different profiles.
### Details:
1. Analyze the data fields extracted from the profiles and identify any inconsistencies in formatting, capitalization, abbreviations, etc.
2. Implement normalization rules to standardize the data format across all profiles.
3. Ensure the normalization process is robust and can handle a wide range of variations in the input data.

## 4. Handle Premium/Restricted Profiles [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add support for extracting data from both public and private (premium/Sales Navigator) profiles.
### Details:
1. Investigate the differences in data availability between public and private LinkedIn profiles.
2. Implement logic to detect if a profile is public or private and adjust the scraping process accordingly.
3. Develop mechanisms to mark profiles as premium/Sales Navigator only when certain data can't be accessed.
4. Ensure the handling of premium/restricted profiles is seamless and does not impact the overall data extraction process.

## 5. Implement Rate Limiting and Anti-Detection Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add rate limiting and anti-detection measures specifically for profile viewing.
### Details:
1. Research and implement rate limiting strategies to prevent overloading LinkedIn's servers and avoid detection.
2. Develop anti-detection mechanisms, such as rotating proxy servers, user-agent randomization, and IP address rotation, to ensure the scraping process is not flagged as suspicious activity.
3. Continuously monitor the scraping process and adjust the rate limiting and anti-detection measures as needed to maintain a stable and uninterrupted data extraction.

## 6. Implement Structured Data Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Develop structured storage of profile data in the database with de-duplication logic to prevent re-scraping of profiles.
### Details:
1. Design a database schema to store the extracted profile data in a structured format.
2. Implement de-duplication logic to ensure that profiles are not re-scraped and stored multiple times.
3. Develop mechanisms to update existing profile data when new information is available.
4. Ensure the data storage process is efficient and can handle a large volume of profiles without performance issues.

## 7. Implement Scraping Progress Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.6
### Description: Create a service for tracking scraping progress and results.
### Details:
1. Develop a service that can monitor the progress of the profile scraping process.
2. Implement mechanisms to track the number of profiles scraped, the success rate, and any errors encountered.
3. Provide a way to visualize the scraping progress and generate reports on the data extraction process.
4. Ensure the progress tracking service is integrated with the overall profile data management system.
