# Title: Profile Data Scraping and Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop profile data extraction, normalization, and storage functionality with de-duplication.
# Details:
Create profile scraping service that extracts detailed information from LinkedIn profiles (name, title, experience, education, etc.). Implement data normalization to ensure consistent format. Develop de-duplication logic to prevent re-scraping profiles. Build structured storage of profile data in the database. Implement error handling for failed scraping attempts. Create a service for tracking scraping progress and results. Develop rate limiting and anti-detection measures specific to profile viewing.

# Test Strategy:
Test profile data extraction with various profile types. Verify data normalization and consistency. Test de-duplication logic with existing profiles. Validate error handling for different failure scenarios during scraping.
