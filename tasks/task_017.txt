# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement MongoDB Connection Pool Management System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a robust MongoDB connection pool management system that optimizes database access, reduces connection overhead, and improves application scalability.
# Details:
The implementation of the MongoDB Connection Pool Management System will be broken down into the following subtasks:

# Test Strategy:
Testing should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test connection acquisition and release under normal conditions
   - Verify connection reuse (connections should be reused rather than recreated)
   - Test pool size limits are respected (create a test that attempts to exceed max connections)
   - Test idle connection cleanup works correctly
   - Verify retry logic functions as expected with simulated connection failures
   - Test graceful shutdown properly closes all connections

2. Integration tests:
   - Test with an actual MongoDB instance to verify end-to-end functionality
   - Measure and verify performance improvements (connection time, resource usage)
   - Test concurrent access with multiple simultaneous operations

3. Load testing:
   - Simulate high load scenarios with many concurrent requests
   - Verify the pool handles connection spikes appropriately
   - Measure metrics under load to ensure they're accurate

4. Failure scenario testing:
   - Test behavior when MongoDB is unavailable
   - Verify application gracefully handles connection failures
   - Test recovery when MongoDB becomes available again

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Use mocking for MongoDB in unit tests to avoid external dependencies.
