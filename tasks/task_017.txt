# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Lead Status Definition Management API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement CRUD APIs for managing the available lead statuses.
# Details:
Create `leadStatusDef.controller.ts` and `leadStatusDef.routes.ts`. Implement secure endpoints (admin only) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting lead status definitions stored via the `LeadStatusDef` model. Ensure deletion prevents removal of statuses currently in use by leads.

# Test Strategy:
API integration tests for CRUD operations on lead status definitions, checking admin authorization, validation, and deletion constraints.
