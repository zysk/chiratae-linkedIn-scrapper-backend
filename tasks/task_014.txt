# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a robust error handling and logging infrastructure that centralizes error management, provides structured logging, categorizes errors, and integrates with external logging services for production environments.
# Details:
Create a modular error handling and logging system with the following components:

1. **Centralized Error Handler**:
   - Implement a global error middleware for Express that catches all unhandled errors
   - Create custom error classes that extend the base Error class (e.g., ValidationError, AuthenticationError, DatabaseError)
   - Include error codes, HTTP status codes, and user-friendly messages

2. **Structured Logging Service**:
   - Develop a logging service with different log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
   - Include contextual information in logs (timestamp, request ID, user ID if available, component/module name)
   - Implement log rotation and compression for file-based logs
   - Replace all console.log statements with the new logging service

3. **Error Categorization**:
   - Distinguish between user errors (400-level HTTP errors) and system errors (500-level HTTP errors)
   - Add metadata to errors to facilitate troubleshooting (stack traces for system errors)
   - Implement different handling strategies based on error type

4. **API Error Response Format**:
   - Define a consistent JSON structure for error responses (e.g., {status, message, code, details})
   - Include appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Filter sensitive information from error responses in production

5. **Selenium Error Handling**:
   - Create specialized error handlers for Selenium operations
   - Implement retry mechanisms for flaky Selenium tests
   - Capture screenshots or page HTML on Selenium failures

6. **External Logging Integration**:
   - Integrate with a production logging service (e.g., Datadog, New Relic, ELK stack)
   - Configure different logging behaviors based on environment (dev, test, prod)
   - Implement log sampling for high-volume environments

The implementation should be configurable and allow for easy extension as new error types or logging requirements emerge.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all aspects of the error handling and logging system:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each custom error class to ensure proper inheritance and property setting
   - Verify the logging service correctly formats and outputs logs at different levels
   - Test error categorization logic with various error scenarios

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify the Express error middleware correctly catches and processes different types of errors
   - Test that API endpoints return properly formatted error responses for various error conditions
   - Confirm that Selenium error handlers properly capture and report failures

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Simulate various error conditions and verify they are properly logged and reported
   - Test the complete error flow from occurrence to logging to client response

4. **Manual Verification**:
   - Review logs in the external logging service to ensure proper formatting and information
   - Verify log rotation and compression work as expected
   - Check that sensitive information is properly filtered in production logs

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure the performance impact of the logging system under high load
   - Test log sampling to ensure it doesn't miss critical errors

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the error handling system remains robust as the application evolves.
