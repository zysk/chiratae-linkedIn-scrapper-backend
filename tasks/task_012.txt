# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Cross-Platform ChromeDriver Configuration for Selenium WebDriver
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a platform-agnostic ChromeDriver configuration system that automatically detects the operating system and uses the appropriate ChromeDriver binary while allowing for custom path configuration.
# Details:
Implement a ChromeDriverManager class that handles cross-platform configuration with the following features:

1. OS Detection:
   - Use `os.name` or equivalent to detect whether the system is Windows or Linux
   - Support for macOS should be considered for future implementation

2. Default Path Configuration:
   - For Windows: Use 'chromedriver/chromedriver-win64/chromedriver.exe'
   - For Linux: Use 'chromedriver/chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver'
   - Ensure paths are resolved relative to the project root

3. File Permission Management:
   - On Linux systems, automatically check and set executable permissions (chmod +x) for the ChromeDriver binary
   - Implement error handling for permission issues

4. Custom Configuration:
   - Create a configuration mechanism that allows specifying custom ChromeDriver paths
   - Support both programmatic configuration and external configuration (e.g., environment variables, config file)
   - Implement a priority system: custom path > environment variable > default path

5. Integration with WebDriver:
   - Create a factory method that returns a properly configured WebDriver instance
   - Ensure the ChromeDriver path is correctly set in the Selenium WebDriver setup
   - Handle common initialization errors with descriptive messages

6. Logging:
   - Add appropriate logging to track which ChromeDriver is being used
   - Log any permission changes or configuration decisions

The implementation should be modular and follow SOLID principles to allow for easy extension to other platforms in the future.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify correct functionality across platforms and configurations:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test OS detection logic with mocked OS information
   - Test path resolution for each supported platform
   - Test permission setting logic (with mocked file system operations)
   - Test configuration priority logic with various combinations of settings

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test on Windows: Verify the Windows ChromeDriver is selected and WebDriver initializes
   - Test on Linux: Verify the Linux ChromeDriver is selected, permissions are set, and WebDriver initializes
   - Test with custom paths: Set custom path via each configuration method and verify it's used
   - Test with invalid paths: Verify appropriate error handling and messages

3. Edge Cases:
   - Test with missing ChromeDriver binaries
   - Test with non-executable ChromeDriver on Linux
   - Test with read-only filesystem locations
   - Test with spaces or special characters in paths

4. CI Integration:
   - Add test jobs for both Windows and Linux in CI pipeline
   - Verify cross-platform compatibility in automated builds

All tests should use a mock browser or headless mode to avoid UI dependencies. Document test results for both platforms to confirm cross-platform functionality.
