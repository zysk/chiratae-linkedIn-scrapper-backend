# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Cross-Platform Compatibility and Docker Containerization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor codebase to ensure consistent behavior across Windows and Linux platforms, and implement Docker containerization as an alternative deployment option.
# Details:
This task involves several key components:

1. **Path Handling**:
   - Replace all hardcoded path separators with `path.join()` and `path.resolve()`
   - Use relative paths where appropriate
   - Implement platform-agnostic file path resolution throughout the codebase

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Implement a consistent approach for loading environment variables (e.g., dotenv)
   - Ensure environment variable paths use proper separators
   - Handle platform-specific environment variable conventions

3. **Platform-Specific Behavior**:
   - Identify and address platform-specific APIs and behaviors
   - Create abstraction layers for OS-specific functionality
   - Handle differences in file system case sensitivity (Windows vs. Linux)

4. **File Permissions**:
   - Implement proper file permission handling for both platforms
   - Use appropriate chmod/chown operations on Linux
   - Ensure executable scripts have correct permissions

5. **Line Endings**:
   - Configure Git to normalize line endings (.gitattributes)
   - Ensure text files use consistent line endings (LF preferred)
   - Add linting rules to enforce consistent line endings

6. **Docker Support (Alternative Deployment Option)**:
   - Create a Dockerfile for the application
   - Implement multi-stage builds if needed
   - Create docker-compose.yml for local development
   - Document Docker usage in README
   - Ensure all application dependencies are properly containerized
   - Configure appropriate volume mounts for development

IMPORTANT: Changes related to Docker containerization should be implemented in isolation and tested thoroughly. If Selenium/browser automation doesn't work correctly in Docker, we may need to revert Docker-specific changes while keeping the cross-platform path handling improvements. Consider implementing Docker support as an alternative deployment option rather than the primary method, allowing the application to run both with and without containerization.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify cross-platform compatibility and Docker functionality:

1. **Automated Tests**:
   - Create unit tests that verify path handling works correctly on both platforms
   - Test environment variable loading on Windows and Linux
   - Implement CI pipeline that runs tests on both Windows and Linux environments

2. **Manual Verification**:
   - Run the application on Windows and Linux to verify identical behavior
   - Test file operations (read/write/execute) on both platforms
   - Verify file permissions work as expected

3. **Docker Testing**:
   - Verify the application builds successfully with Docker
   - Test Docker container on both Windows and Linux hosts
   - Validate that containerized application behaves identically to local development
   - Verify volume mounts work correctly for development workflow
   - Test Docker Compose setup with all required services

4. **Regression Testing**:
   - Create a checklist of platform-specific features to verify
   - Implement automated tests that catch platform-specific regressions
   - Document any remaining platform-specific behaviors that cannot be eliminated

5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Compare application performance between platforms
   - Identify and document any performance differences between containerized and native environments
