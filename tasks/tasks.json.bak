ESLint Configuration:\n   - Review and update the existing ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.js` or create one if it doesn't exist\n   - Configure rules to prohibit console statements (`no-console`)\n   - Enable rules for unused variables (`no-unused-vars`)\n   - Configure TypeScript-specific rules to prevent `any` types (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`)\n   - Add appropriate exceptions where necessary\n\n2. Fix Identified Issues:\n   - Run `npm run lint:fix` to identify all linting issues\n   - Remove all `console.log`, `console.error`, etc. statements from the codebase\n   - Remove or utilize all unused variables\n   - Replace all explicit `any` types with proper type definitions\n\n3. Implement Error Logging Strategy:\n   - Create a centralized logging service/utility that can be imported throughout the codebase\n   - Implement different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)\n   - Configure the logger to output to appropriate channels based on the environment (development, testing, production)\n   - For production, ensure logs are properly formatted for log aggregation services\n   - Add context information to logs (e.g., timestamp, component/file name, user info if applicable)\n\n4. Replace Console Statements:\n   - Replace all console statements with the new logging utility\n   - Ensure proper log levels are used based on the context\n   - Add meaningful error messages and context information\n\n5. Documentation:\n   - Document the new logging approach in the project README or wiki\n   - Provide examples of proper logging usage for other developers",

Linting Verification:\n   - Run `npm run lint` (without fix) and confirm no linting errors related to console statements, unused variables, or any types\n   - Verify this on a clean build to ensure all files are checked\n   - Run the check in CI pipeline to ensure it passes\n\n2. Code Review:\n   - Perform a thorough code review to ensure all console statements have been replaced with the logging utility\n   - Verify that all previously unused variables are now either used or removed\n   - Check that explicit any types have been replaced with proper types\n\n3. Logging Implementation Testing:\n   - Write unit tests for the logging utility to ensure it functions correctly\n   - Test each log level to verify correct behavior\n   - Mock the output channels to verify logs are sent to the correct destinations\n   - Test environment-specific behavior (dev vs prod logging)\n\n4. Integration Testing:\n   - Trigger various error conditions in the application and verify they are properly logged\n   - Check that log messages contain appropriate context information\n   - Verify that sensitive information is not being logged\n\n5. Performance Testing:\n   - Ensure the logging implementation doesn't significantly impact application performance\n   - Test with high volume of logs to verify performance under load",

Default Path Configuration:\n   - For Windows: Use 'chromedriver/chromedriver-win64/chromedriver.exe'\n   - For Linux: Use 'chromedriver/chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver'\n   - Ensure paths are resolved relative to the project root\n\n3. File Permission Management:\n   - On Linux systems, automatically check and set executable permissions (chmod +x) for the ChromeDriver binary\n   - Implement error handling for permission issues\n\n4. Custom Configuration:\n   - Create a configuration mechanism that allows specifying custom ChromeDriver paths\n   - Support both programmatic configuration and external configuration (e.g., environment variables, config file)\n   - Implement a priority system: custom path > environment variable > default path\n\n5. Integration with WebDriver:\n   - Create a factory method that returns a properly configured WebDriver instance\n   - Ensure the ChromeDriver path is correctly set in the Selenium WebDriver setup\n   - Handle common initialization errors with descriptive messages\n\n6. Logging:\n   - Add appropriate logging to track which ChromeDriver is being used\n   - Log any permission changes or configuration decisions\n\nThe implementation should be modular and follow SOLID principles to allow for easy extension to other platforms in the future.",

Unit Tests:\n   - Test OS detection logic with mocked OS information\n   - Test path resolution for each supported platform\n   - Test permission setting logic (with mocked file system operations)\n   - Test configuration priority logic with various combinations of settings\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Test on Windows: Verify the Windows ChromeDriver is selected and WebDriver initializes\n   - Test on Linux: Verify the Linux ChromeDriver is selected, permissions are set, and WebDriver initializes\n   - Test with custom paths: Set custom path via each configuration method and verify it's used\n   - Test with invalid paths: Verify appropriate error handling and messages\n\n3. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with missing ChromeDriver binaries\n   - Test with non-executable ChromeDriver on Linux\n   - Test with read-only filesystem locations\n   - Test with spaces or special characters in paths\n\n4. CI Integration:\n   - Add test jobs for both Windows and Linux in CI pipeline\n   - Verify cross-platform compatibility in automated builds\n\nAll tests should use a mock browser or headless mode to avoid UI dependencies.
