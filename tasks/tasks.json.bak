Fix Identified Issues:\n   - Run `npm run lint:fix` to identify all linting issues\n   - Remove all `console.log`, `console.error`, etc. statements from the codebase\n   - Remove or utilize all unused variables\n   - Replace all explicit `any` types with proper type definitions\n\n3. Implement Error Logging Strategy:\n   - Create a centralized logging service/utility that can be imported throughout the codebase\n   - Implement different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)\n   - Configure the logger to output to appropriate channels based on the environment (development, testing, production)\n   - For production, ensure logs are properly formatted for log aggregation services\n   - Add context information to logs (e.g., timestamp, component/file name, user info if applicable)\n\n4. Replace Console Statements:\n   - Replace all console statements with the new logging utility\n   - Ensure proper log levels are used based on the context\n   - Add meaningful error messages and context information\n\n5.

Code Review:\n   - Perform a thorough code review to ensure all console statements have been replaced with the logging utility\n   - Verify that all previously unused variables are now either used or removed\n   - Check that explicit any types have been replaced with proper types\n\n3. Logging Implementation Testing:\n   - Write unit tests for the logging utility to ensure it functions correctly\n   - Test each log level to verify correct behavior\n   - Mock the output channels to verify logs are sent to the correct destinations\n   - Test environment-specific behavior (dev vs prod logging)\n\n4. Integration Testing:\n   - Trigger various error conditions in the application and verify they are properly logged\n   - Check that log messages contain appropriate context information\n   - Verify that sensitive information is not being logged\n\n5.

OS Detection:\n   - Use `os.name` or equivalent to detect whether the system is Windows or Linux\n   - Support for macOS should be considered for future implementation\n\n2. Default Path Configuration:\n   - For Windows: Use 'chromedriver/chromedriver-win64/chromedriver.exe'\n   - For Linux: Use 'chromedriver/chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver'\n   - Ensure paths are resolved relative to the project root\n\n3. File Permission Management:\n   - On Linux systems, automatically check and set executable permissions (chmod +x) for the ChromeDriver binary\n   - Implement error handling for permission issues\n\n4. Custom Configuration:\n   - Create a configuration mechanism that allows specifying custom ChromeDriver paths\n   - Support both programmatic configuration and external configuration (e.g., environment variables, config file)\n   - Implement a priority system: custom path > environment variable > default path\n\n5. Integration with WebDriver:\n   - Create a factory method that returns a properly configured WebDriver instance\n   - Ensure the ChromeDriver path is correctly set in the Selenium WebDriver setup\n   - Handle common initialization errors with descriptive messages\n\n6. Logging:\n   - Add appropriate logging to track which ChromeDriver is being used\n   - Log any permission changes or configuration decisions\n\nThe implementation should be modular and follow SOLID principles to allow for easy extension to other platforms in the future.",

If Selenium/browser automation doesn't work correctly in Docker, we may need to revert Docker-specific changes while keeping the cross-platform path handling improvements. Consider implementing Docker support as an alternative deployment option rather than the primary method, allowing the application to run both with and without containerization.",
