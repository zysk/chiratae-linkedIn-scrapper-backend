# Task ID: 3
# Title: LinkedIn Account and Proxy Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement models and API endpoints for managing LinkedIn accounts and proxy servers with secure credential storage.
# Details:
1. Create LinkedIn Account model with encrypted password storage
2. Implement encryption/decryption utilities using a secure library (crypto)
3. Create CRUD API endpoints for LinkedIn accounts
4. Implement Proxy model for storing proxy server details
5. Create CRUD API endpoints for proxy management
6. Add validation for proxy formats and authentication
7. Implement proxy rotation logic
8. Add usage tracking for both LinkedIn accounts and proxies
9. Create middleware to restrict these endpoints to admin users only
10. Implement secure retrieval of decrypted credentials for internal use

# Test Strategy:
1. Test encryption/decryption of credentials
2. Verify CRUD operations for both models
3. Test proxy validation logic
4. Verify admin-only access to endpoints
5. Test proxy rotation functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create LinkedIn Account Model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the LinkedIn Account model with encrypted password storage using a secure encryption library (e.g., crypto)
### Details:
1. Define the LinkedIn Account model with fields like username, encrypted_password, and other relevant details.
2. Implement the encryption/decryption utilities using a secure library like crypto to handle password storage securely.
3. Ensure the password is encrypted before storing in the database.

## 2. Implement CRUD API Endpoints for LinkedIn Accounts [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create API endpoints for managing LinkedIn accounts (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
### Details:
1. Implement the necessary API endpoints (e.g., /linkedin-accounts, /linkedin-accounts/{id}) to perform CRUD operations on the LinkedIn Account model.
2. Ensure the API endpoints are properly secured and only accessible to authorized users.

## 3. Create Proxy Model and CRUD API Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the Proxy model and API endpoints for managing proxy servers
### Details:
1. Define the Proxy model with fields like host, port, username, encrypted_password, and other relevant details.
2. Implement the CRUD API endpoints (e.g., /proxies, /proxies/{id}) to manage the Proxy model.

## 4. Implement Proxy Validation and Authentication [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Add validation for proxy formats and authentication
### Details:
1. Implement validation logic to ensure the proxy details (host, port, username, password) are in the correct format.
2. Integrate proxy authentication mechanisms (e.g., basic authentication, API keys) to secure the proxy management endpoints.

## 5. Implement Proxy Rotation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop the logic for rotating proxy servers
### Details:
1. Implement the proxy rotation logic to automatically switch between available proxies based on usage, performance, or other criteria.
2. Ensure the proxy rotation is transparent to the client applications using the API.

## 6. Implement Usage Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Add usage tracking for LinkedIn accounts and proxies
### Details:
1. Implement usage tracking mechanisms to monitor the utilization of LinkedIn accounts and proxy servers.
2. Store the usage data (e.g., timestamp, account/proxy used, request details) for reporting and analysis purposes.

## 7. Implement Admin-only Access [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.6
### Description: Create middleware to restrict the API endpoints to admin users only
### Details:
1. Implement middleware to authenticate and authorize users accessing the LinkedIn account and proxy management API endpoints.
2. Ensure only authorized admin users can perform CRUD operations and access the usage tracking data.
