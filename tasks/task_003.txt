# Task ID: 3
# Title: LinkedIn Account and Proxy Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure storage and management of LinkedIn credentials and proxy servers with rotation capabilities.
# Details:
Create LinkedIn Account model with secure credential storage using encryption. Implement CRUD operations for LinkedIn accounts with proper validation. Develop usage tracking and status monitoring for accounts. Create Proxy model for storing proxy server details with support for authenticated and non-authenticated proxies. Implement CRUD operations for proxies with validation. Build a proxy rotation service that selects appropriate proxies based on usage patterns. Implement access control to ensure only admins can manage these resources.

# Test Strategy:
Test secure storage of credentials with encryption. Verify CRUD operations for both LinkedIn accounts and proxies. Test proxy validation functionality. Ensure proper access control for admin-only operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design LinkedIn Account Model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the data model for storing LinkedIn account details, including secure credential storage using encryption. Identify the necessary fields and their validation requirements.
### Details:
1. Identify the required fields for the LinkedIn Account model, such as username, password, account status, last login time, etc.
2. Determine the appropriate data types and validation rules for each field (e.g., username length, password complexity).
3. Implement secure credential storage using encryption techniques like AES or RSA to protect sensitive information.
4. Ensure the model adheres to best practices for data modeling and security.

## 2. Implement CRUD Operations for LinkedIn Accounts [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop the backend API to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the LinkedIn Account model, with proper validation and error handling.
### Details:
1. Implement the necessary controller, service, and repository layers to handle CRUD operations for the LinkedIn Account model.
2. Ensure all operations validate the input data according to the model's requirements.
3. Implement error handling to provide meaningful responses for invalid requests.
4. Thoroughly test the CRUD operations to ensure they function as expected.

## 3. Develop LinkedIn Account Usage Tracking and Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Implement a system to track the usage and status of LinkedIn accounts, including login attempts, successful logins, and account lockouts.
### Details:
1. Design a usage tracking model to store information about each account's login attempts, successful logins, and account lockouts.
2. Integrate the usage tracking functionality into the LinkedIn Account service to capture the necessary data.
3. Implement a monitoring dashboard or reporting system to visualize the usage patterns and status of the LinkedIn accounts.
4. Ensure the usage data is stored securely and can be accessed by authorized users only.

## 4. Design Proxy Server Model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the data model for storing proxy server details, including support for authenticated and non-authenticated proxies.
### Details:
1. Identify the required fields for the Proxy Server model, such as host, port, username, password, authentication type, and status.
2. Determine the appropriate data types and validation rules for each field (e.g., host and port format, username and password length).
3. Ensure the model can handle both authenticated and non-authenticated proxy servers.
4. Implement the Proxy Server model, adhering to best practices for data modeling and security.

## 5. Implement CRUD Operations for Proxy Servers [done]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop the backend API to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the Proxy Server model, with proper validation and error handling.
### Details:
1. Implement the necessary controller, service, and repository layers to handle CRUD operations for the Proxy Server model.
2. Ensure all operations validate the input data according to the model's requirements.
3. Implement error handling to provide meaningful responses for invalid requests.
4. Thoroughly test the CRUD operations to ensure they function as expected.

## 6. Implement Proxy Rotation Service [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.5
### Description: Develop a service that selects appropriate proxies based on usage patterns and rotates them to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
### Details:
1. Analyze the usage data collected for the LinkedIn accounts and proxy servers to identify patterns and trends.
2. Implement a proxy selection algorithm that considers factors like proxy availability, performance, and usage history to select the most appropriate proxy for a given request.
3. Develop a proxy rotation mechanism that automatically switches to a different proxy when the current one becomes unavailable or underperforms.
4. Ensure the proxy rotation service is integrated with the LinkedIn Account service to seamlessly handle proxy selection and rotation.

## 7. Implement Access Control for LinkedIn Accounts and Proxies [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.5
### Description: Develop an access control system to ensure only authorized users (e.g., admins) can manage the LinkedIn accounts and proxy servers.
### Details:
1. Implement a user management system with roles and permissions.
2. Ensure only users with the appropriate permissions can perform CRUD operations on the LinkedIn Accounts and Proxy Servers.
3. Implement access control checks in the backend API to enforce the permission rules.
4. Provide a user interface for administrators to manage user accounts and their permissions.
