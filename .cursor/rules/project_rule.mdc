- This project is a revamp of an existing project.
	- Go through `old-code` to analyze the business logic of previous project.
	- Keep a check with the requirement document `docs\linkedin-scrapper-requirement-details.md`, `scripts\prd.txt` and the tasks generated by task-master.
	- Make sure the business logic is replicated exactly from the previous codebase keeping better optimization, usability and best practices in mind.
	- Alway try to use the available MCP tools like Context7, Sequential Thinking, MongoDB and what not.
	- The local dev server is running alreadly, don't try to explicitely run it.
	- While generating postman collection for new task, always merge it with all the previously generated collections and generate a single collection file.
	- After successfull testing using Postman and MongoDB MCP tool, reanalyze the respective task(s) as per the previous implementaiton and update it accordingly.
