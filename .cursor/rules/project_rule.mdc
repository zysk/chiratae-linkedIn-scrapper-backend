- This project is a revamp of an existing project.
	- Go through `old-code` to analyze the business logic of previous project.
	- Keep a check with the requirement document `docs\linkedin-scrapper-requirement-details.md`, `scripts\prd.txt` and the tasks generated by task-master.
	- Make sure the business logic is replicated exactly from the previous codebase keeping better optimization, usability and best practices in mind.
	- Alway try to use the available MCP tools like Context7, Sequential Thinking, MongoDB and what not.
